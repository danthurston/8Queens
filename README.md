# Recursively Backtracking the 8-Queens
## A backtracking solution to the classic 8 Queens problem. 

This Java application solves the 8 queens problem through a backtracking approach.
The 8 queens puzzle is the challenge of positioning 8 queens on an 8x8 chessboard so that no queens are threatened. That is, they are positioned so that none of the 8 queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

This approach utilizes backtracking to find all possible positions for any selected square on the chessboard which the user can iterate through.
